My team and I have collaborated to update our individual files, which together form the foundation of our open-source project. For instance, I was responsible for drafting the LICENSE.md file, where I outlined the type of licensing our project would follow. After discussing it as a group, we collectively decided on the MIT licens

I also began initializing some key files. These files include `manifest.json` which defines the details about the extension, such as its name, version, permissions, and the files it uses. The other file was the `content.js` which our group will edit together to add the necessary features.

During this time, I watched a few videos to better understand the process of manipulating webpages for Chrome extensions. The videos I referenced were:

- [Chrome Extensions: Content Scripts - Programming with Text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tl3OmwrSaM&t=779s)
