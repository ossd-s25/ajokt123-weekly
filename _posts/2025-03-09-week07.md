#Project Reflection:

After teams were finalized, we have been working on narrowing down potential projects to contribute to. It seems that we all still want to take a somewhat creative approach, with a continued interest in JavaScript and TypeScript.

Initially, we had our sights set on Abbreve, which seemed like a viable option. The website appeared to be a friendly and accessible project for contributions. However, I was unable to attend the last class session, where the team ultimately decided to explore other options due to communication issues with the project's maintainers.

Following this, my team members proposed alternative ideas, including Lucide and Excalidraw.

At our next meeting, we plan to further explore Lucide, as it aligns well with our interests by incorporating both JavaScript and TypeScript.

I think the biggest challenge so far has been finding a project that meets enough of our criteria to make it a strong and worthwhile contribution opportunity.
