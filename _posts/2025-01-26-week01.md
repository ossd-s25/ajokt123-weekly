# Open Source : Advantages and Disadvantages

When I hear the term open source, I think about access and how something is avaialable openly. One advantage of open source vs closed soure is the community collaboration which ultimately leads to continuous improvement and innovation within a project. 

Another advantage would be that it is cost effective because it is normally free to use it reduces the cost for individuals who want to use and contirbute to it. A disadvantage to open source software would be that some open-source projects require technical expertise to install,

configure, and maintain which may be difficult to less-experiences users who may want to contribute. Another disadvantage would be security risks due to the amount of people that are contributing to the project making it more vulnerable to hackers and other threats.

I decided to register for an open-source software development course because I wanted to experience contributing to an existing project. Up until this point, the courses I have taken have focused on building my own programs or creating solutions from scratch. This course will be a different experience because I will have the opportunity to make meaningful and possibly even exciting contributions to projects that are already out there.

# Open Source Projects:

## Visual Studio Code
I have been using Visual Studio Code for the past year and a half. I chose to highlight this particular project because I have used other code editors before, and I’ve found Visual Studio Code to be the most user-friendly for me. My favorite aspect of VS Code that showcases the contributions of others is its unique and fun extensions, such as VS Code Pets, which lets you have a small window with a variety of virtual pets on your coding screen. Additionally, I love the wide selection of customized themes created by contributors, which have ultimately made the environment feel more personalized.

## Khan Academy
I chose to highlight this platform because I’ve explored several educational resources before, and I’ve found Khan Academy to be one of the most engaging and user-friendly for self-paced learning. While it's not fully open-source, Khan Academy has made a lot of its content publicly available, and there is an open-source initiative for parts of its code, allowing developers to contribute to the platform's growth. What stands out to me are the interactive exercises and quizzes, which really make the learning experience more enjoyable. Additionally, I appreciate how contributors have helped expand the variety of subjects and topics available on the platform. This has made the learning environment feel personalized and diverse.

## Wikipedia
I love how wikipedia is built and continuously updated by a vast community of volunteers, making it a living source of knowledge. Even though everything on Wikipedia is not open-sourced, its content is freely available, and anyone can contribute by editing articles or adding new information. This collaborative aspect is what I find most exciting. I also appreciate the transparent editorial process, where contributors provide citations and references, making sure the content is reliable and accurate.

## Urban Dictionary
I’ve been using Urban Dictionary for years, and I chose to highlight it because it’s a unique platform where people can contribute definitions for slang terms, cultural phrases, and internet lingo. What I find most intriguing about Urban Dictionary is that it’s driven by its users, with anyone able to submit definitions, vote on entries, and add new phrases. The content is constantly evolving and reflects real-time trends and language changes. It’s also a fun and insightful way to understand modern culture and language, offering a personal, crowd-sourced perspective that you won't find in a traditional dictionary.
