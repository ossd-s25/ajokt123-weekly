# Project Updates
The progress I have made in gthe group thus far is the discussion toward creating the peace sign icon. There have been a few different edits made to the icon itself to make sure that it is meeting the conditions and guidelines of a lucide icon. There were issues with the margin and a pixel-gap violation that other contributors brought to the attention of the issue. Now that those have been solved I will work on opening a pull request for the icon.

I really enjoyed the presentation. I appreciated hearing his perspective and journey of contribting to open source projects over the course of his academic career and outside of it as well. It was very relatable because he described taking on a big issue that he didnt initially think was a large task until he realized there were many additional layers to it.  <!--more-->
I also appreciated his insights in regards to programs that he recommended such as Google Summer of Code, Igalia, and Outreachy. These programs are ones that I will look into in the near future.

Codetribute is also a website that I will continue to look into for further contributions because of how accessible and beginner-friendly it makes open source involvement, especially by connecting contributors directly with mentored issues and clearly outlining the steps to get started with real-world Mozilla projects.
