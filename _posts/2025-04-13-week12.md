find two or three companies that have an open source program office and try to figure out who the people in that office are and what they are doing

make your blog post:
reflect on the lessons for The Cathedral and the Bazaar essay, talk about two or three from the perspective of what you are observing in the project that you are working on with your group
reflect on the Coffeehouse idea that Clause Warren was talking about
in your own words, talk about the role OSPO play in the companies that you found


# The Cathedral and the Bazaar Reflection:

# Coffeehouse Reflections:
Claude Warren’s “Coffeehouse” metaphor really stuck with me. It offers a new way of thinking about open source not just as a structured process or chaotic marketplace, but as a relaxed space where ideas can flow freely. The coffeehouse isn’t about formal meetings or perfectly planned roadmaps. What I like about this model is how it values conversation over perfection. You don’t have to have the “right” answer just showing up and offering a perspective is enough. Even a simple comment or question can spark something bigger. <!--more--> It’s a reminder that contributions come in all forms, not just code. It also captures the social side of open source that often gets overlooked. People aren’t just collaborating they’re connecting. And that kind of environment, where you can casually explore ideas without pressure, is often where the most unexpected and creative breakthroughs happen.

# OSPO Reflection:

## Google:
The OSPO at Google is part of the Google Open Source team, led by folks like Chris DiBona (previously) and currently overseen by a rotating set of program managers and engineers.

What they do:

Manage internal/external open source contributions

Set compliance rules and licensing policies

Run projects like Kubernetes, TensorFlow, and Go
