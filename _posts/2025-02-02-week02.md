This text should be replaced by your second post.

The easiest way to make your second post is to edit this one.
Go into /_posts/ and update the 2025-02-02-week02.md file.



On your own, address the questions from the activity in your weekly blog. Do not write the blog as a sequence of questions and answers. Instead, create couple of paragraphs that address the issues.

Part 1
# Code of Conduct:
A project's Code of Conduct creates explicit guidelines for respectful and inclusive conduct, guaranteeing a friendly atmosphere for individuals from various backgrounds. It holds members responsible for their behavior and promotes positive communication. This type of document would be very helpful to other projects, particularly ones that get alot of participation.

# Differences in Code of Conduct:

The Go Project's Code of Conduct includes a detailed Conflict Resolution section, which encourages individuals to address issues directly and providing a clear process for reporting problems to project owners. It also outlines how conflicts are investigated and resolved. However, the Contributor Covenant mentions reporting abusive behavior but lacks a structured conflict resolution process. I think the Go Project includes this section to ensure clear and transparent handling of issues, especially given its large, diverse contributor population.

The second difference is the Scope of Representation. The Go Project Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and when representing the project in public, such as through emails or events. The Contributor Covenant, however, focuses mainly on behavior within project spaces and doesn't mention public representation. The Go Project likely included this to ensure contributors act respectfully in all settings, protecting the projectâ€™s image.


#PROMPT TO FINISH
The Contributor Covenant website has a list of projects that adapted their code of conduct. Eclipse is one of the listed projects. Try to find the code of conduct document for Eclipse. Post the link as part of your answer. You will discover that this document has different structure and content than the one for the Go project. Try to explain why that is.

Part 2
Visit the code of conduct document for the Sugar Labs project. Note that it is located in the legal section of their wiki page.

Read through this document. Compare it to the code of conduct for the Go project. Is this document based on another code of conduct?

Part 3
Pick an open source project. (It could be a project that you are familiar with, or a project that you are interested in, or something you encountered in one of the class discussions). Try to find the code of conduct document for that project. Note that it may not have a code of conduct or that it may be called differently. Include a link to it (if you find it) and compare it to the two "templates" that you looked at in parts 1 and 2. If the project does not have a code of conduct document, write a proposal for such a document.

Deliverable
A blog post that contains the answers to prompts in parts 1-3.
