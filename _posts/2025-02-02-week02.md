# Code of Conduct:
A project's Code of Conduct creates explicit guidelines for respectful and inclusive conduct, guaranteeing a friendly atmosphere for individuals from various backgrounds. It holds members responsible for their behavior and promotes positive communication. This type of document would be very helpful to other projects, particularly ones that get alot of participation.

# Differences in Code of Conduct:
The Go Project's Code of Conduct includes a detailed Conflict Resolution section, which encourages individuals to address issues directly and providing a clear process for reporting problems to project owners. It also outlines how conflicts are investigated and resolved. However, the Contributor Covenant mentions reporting abusive behavior but lacks a structured conflict resolution process. I think the Go Project includes this section to ensure clear and transparent handling of issues, especially given its large, diverse contributor population.

The second difference is the Scope of Representation. The Go Project Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and when representing the project in public, such as through emails or events. The Contributor Covenant, however, focuses mainly on behavior within project spaces and doesn't mention public representation. The Go Project likely included this to ensure contributors act respectfully in all settings, protecting the projectâ€™s image.


# Eclipse Code of Conduct:
The second key difference is in how detailed the two codes are. The Eclipse Code of Conduct is more formal and detailed, laying out clear expectations, unacceptable behavior, consequences, and how to report incidents. It's structured like an official policy for the entire Eclipse community, covering a range of situations. In contrast, the Contributor Covenant is shorter and simpler, focusing mainly on promoting inclusivity and safe participation. It's more of a straightforward guide for open-source projects without getting into as many specific rules or procedures.

# Sugar Lab and Ubuntu Code of Conduct:
The Sugar Labs Code of Conduct is indeed based on the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. This is explicitly mentioned in the document itself, which states that it follows the Ubuntu model and is licensed under Creative Commons. 

Part 3
Pick an open source project. (It could be a project that you are familiar with, or a project that you are interested in, or something you encountered in one of the class discussions). Try to find the code of conduct document for that project. Note that it may not have a code of conduct or that it may be called differently. Include a link to it (if you find it) and compare it to the two "templates" that you looked at in parts 1 and 2. If the project does not have a code of conduct document, write a proposal for such a document.

# Wikipedia Code of Conduct:
[Wiki Code of Conduct] (https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Policy:Universal_Code_of_Conduct)

I noticed that the Wikimedia Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC) is broader and more formal than both the Sugar Labs and Go project code of conducts. It is more targeted toward the  global wider community across Wiki projects making sure their standards are consistent worldwide. They also emphasizes inclusivity, respect, and accountability, as well as preventing harassment similar to the other code of conduct documents.
