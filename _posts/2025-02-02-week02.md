This text should be replaced by your second post.

The easiest way to make your second post is to edit this one.
Go into /_posts/ and update the 2025-02-02-week02.md file.



On your own, address the questions from the activity in your weekly blog. Do not write the blog as a sequence of questions and answers. Instead, create couple of paragraphs that address the issues.

Part 1
Visit the code of conduct document for the Go project. Read the document carefully. In your own words explain the benefits of having such a document for a project. Do you think other projects would benefit from having such a document?

Follow the link at the bottom of the above document to the Contributor Covenant website. Find two differences between the two code of conduct documents. Try to explain why the Go project might have made those changes.

The Contributor Covenant website has a list of projects that adapted their code of conduct. Eclipse is one of the listed projects. Try to find the code of conduct document for Eclipse. Post the link as part of your answer. You will discover that this document has different structure and content than the one for the Go project. Try to explain why that is.

Part 2
Visit the code of conduct document for the Sugar Labs project. Note that it is located in the legal section of their wiki page.

Read through this document. Compare it to the code of conduct for the Go project. Is this document based on another code of conduct?

Part 3
Pick an open source project. (It could be a project that you are familiar with, or a project that you are interested in, or something you encountered in one of the class discussions). Try to find the code of conduct document for that project. Note that it may not have a code of conduct or that it may be called differently. Include a link to it (if you find it) and compare it to the two "templates" that you looked at in parts 1 and 2. If the project does not have a code of conduct document, write a proposal for such a document.

Deliverable
A blog post that contains the answers to prompts in parts 1-3.
