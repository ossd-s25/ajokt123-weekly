# Reflections on Preswald and Hugging Face Projects

## Preswald: Fast Progress in a New Project

Preswald’s project stood out because of how new it is, the codebase is still developing, which gave the team opportunities to build full features and work directly with the founders. They also improved the documentation, helping future contributors get started more easily. I also liked how they dealt with setbacks on the chatbot feature by building on existing code. Splitting into pairs early on helped their workflow and showed strong teamwork.

## Hugging Face: Embracing Complexity

Hugging Face’s project was highly technical and focused on AI and machine learning. I don’t have much experience in that area, so I know I would have found it tough. But the team made solid contributions and clearly understood the challenges. Their visual workflow was helpful and reminded me of my own experience with Lucide. I also liked their slide about time-based strategy. Even though some parts were very technical, the depth of their work came through clearly.
