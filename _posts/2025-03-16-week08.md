# Presentation Reflections

## History of Open Source 
Something I found really interesting was how early computer users had no textbooks, courses, or instructions and had to figure everything out themselves. The formation of the SHARE group in 1955 shows how collaboration and open problem-solving were essential from the start. It’s cool to see that even IBM encouraged sharing solutions, which contrasts with how proprietary software models later developed.

The rise of Linux, Apache, and Mozilla in the 1990s and early 2000s also caught my attention. Seeing how open-source software started as a grassroots movement and then became a dominant force in tech showing it could even be a business model with companies like Red Hat—is really exciting. It shows how community-driven projects can shape entire industries. 

## Individual Presentations
Out the student presentations, I found the one on Mitchell Baker  interesting to read. Her impact on open-source software and internet freedom stood out, especially her role in creating the Mozilla Public License and leading the development of Firefox. It was cool to learn how she worked to keep the internet open and accessible. I also thought it was cool that she originally studied Chinese Studies—it’s always interesting to see how people’s career paths can take unexpected turns.


## Nick Vidal Presentation
Nick Vidal’s presentation was really interesting, especially in how it framed the evolving role of open source in AI. The breakdown of the Open Source AI Definition stood out to me it was helpful to see how open-source AI is structured around the four freedoms (use, study, modify, and share) along with open weights, open code, and data transparency.

I also liked learning about different open-source initiatives, like the Open Policy Alliance and ClearlyDefined, which emphasize legal clarity and standards. It was eye-opening to see how much effort goes into ensuring open-source AI remains accessible and ethical.

This presentation definitely shifted my perspective on open-source AI. I had previously thought of open-source mainly in the context of traditional software, but now I see how its principles are being extended to AI in ways that balance openness with accountability.
