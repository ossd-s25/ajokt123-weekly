I found the Git exercises we did incredibly helpful. Not only did I get to read about and hear explanations of various commands, but seeing the process in action and applying it to our project and other classes made the learning experience significantly more valuable.

I also really enjoyed seeing what everyone had been working on over the past week. It’s easy to become fixated on our own projects and feel proud of our progress, but viewing the creative and out-of-the-box ideas from others was truly inspiring. I found it fascinating that very few projects resembled each other, which highlights how each group brought a unique approach to the assignment.

My biggest takeaway from my group’s work was learning not to be afraid to challenge myself. For this project, I had little experience with the languages we used to build our extension. However, searching for resources and figuring things was incredibly rewarding. By the end, I gained more confidence in stepping outside my comfort zone and expanding my technical skill set. In this class, I hope to continue experimenting with languages I am less familiar with and push myself to grow even further.
