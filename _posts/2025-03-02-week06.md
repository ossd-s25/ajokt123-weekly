#Contribution Reflection

So far, my small contributions to Wikipedia have focused on improving grammar, clarity, and tone in articles. I have been able to make minor but meaningful edits, such as refining phrasing in the Kery James article to enhance readability and neutrality. Similarly, in the Gawaher article, I adjusted word choices to remove casual or potentially biased language, ensuring a more professional and objective tone.

The biggest challenge I have faced is making edits that improve the article while avoiding the need for citations, as even small wording changes must align with Wikipediaâ€™s neutrality guidelines. I am most proud of my contributions to the Gawaher article because I was able to make multiple refinements that significantly improved the clarity and professionalism of the content. These contributions, though small, reinforce the importance of maintaining high-quality, accessible information on Wikipedia.
